# react-course-2024

My repo for the famous React udemy course: [Link to course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

This repo includes source code from the course material and my modifications following this video-based course. I followed this course in 2022 but did not complete. Since it's been updated extensively I am going over it again.
