# react-course-2024

My repo for the React course on udemy: [Link to course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

This repo includes source code from the course material and my modifications following this video-based course. I followed this course in 2022 but did not complete. Since it's been updated extensively I am going over it again, albeit slowly!

[Notes](/notes.md)

Highlighted topics it covers

- Custom Hooks
- React Context API
- Redux
- React Router
- TanStack Query
- Next.js
- React + TypeScript

Skipped:

- Section 14: Class-based components
- Lecture 426: Instead of using Tanstack `useMutation`, Max tried to integrate Tanstack with React Router's `action`.
- Old course content

It's a very comprehensive course to React! Overall, I highly recommend it.

I recommend skipping these:

- S14: Class-based components
- S22: React Router (use Next.js for routing instead)
- Part of S26: "Pages Router" of Next.js

These may be optional:

- S25: Tanstack Query
- S28: Animating React Apps (Framer Motion)
